      The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks
      can be bought and sold. When an investor buys a stock, they become a
      shareholder and own a small portion of the company. As the company
      performs well and earns profits, the value of the stock typically
      increases, allowing the shareholder to sell their shares at a higher
      price. However, if the company performs poorly, the value of the stock may
      decrease, resulting in a loss for the shareholder. The stock market is
      often used as a measure of a country's overall economic health. The two
      main stock markets in the United States are the New York Stock Exchange
      (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.
